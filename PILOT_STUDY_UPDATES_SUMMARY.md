### 7. **Team Role Clarifications**
- **Rog:** Facilitates instructions, guides participants, conducts interviews
- **Yuan:** CrazyFlie operations, battery management, technical monitoring
- **Ju:** VR setup, headset sanitization between participants
- **Recommended 4th member:** Battery charging monitor and logger

### 8. **Participant Safety Enhancements**
- Clearer emergency stop procedures in participant briefing
- Description of CrazyFlie Brushless 2.1 features (lightweight, quiet)
- Motor cooling between flights
- VR hygiene protocols (face covers, sanitization)
- Fatigue monitoring

### 9. **Documentation & Logging**

#### Battery Tracking Log Template:
| Participant ID | Battery Used | Start Voltage | End Voltage | Flight Duration | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|

#### Additional Logs:
- Battery cycle count tracking
- Equipment condition notes
- Incident/malfunction documentation

### 10. **Environmental Considerations**
- Room temperature control (18-24°C)
- Ventilation requirements
- Lighting control for VR/cameras
- "Study in Progress" signage

## Critical Safety Reminders

### Never:
- Leave charging batteries unattended
- Charge hot batteries (wait for cool-down)
- Fly with battery below 3.9V per cell
- Use water on LiPo fire
- Store batteries fully charged or depleted

### Always:
- Check battery voltage before each flight
- Log battery usage for each participant
- Allow motor cool-down between flights (2-3 min)
- Keep fire extinguisher accessible
- Monitor participant comfort and safety

## Recommended Pre-Study Actions

## Questions to Clarify

1. Do you have a backup CrazyFlie Brushless 2.1 unit?
2. What is the capacity (mAh) of your 7 batteries?
3. Is your 4-port charger a balance charger with cell monitoring?
4. Do you have a Class D fire extinguisher, or should one be obtained?
5. Will participants be scheduled with exact time slots or rolling availability?
6. Do you have insurance/liability waivers beyond consent forms?
