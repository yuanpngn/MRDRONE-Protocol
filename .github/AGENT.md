# MR.Drone — Copilot Agenda

> Drop this file at `.github/AGEND.md`. Open it side‑by‑side with the files you’re editing so Copilot can see goals, constraints, and filenames. Use the “Task Prompts” verbatim inside Copilot Chat (VS Code, JetBrains, or GitHub.com).

## Project Snapshot (for Copilot context)
- Goal: Prototype an **MR‑augmented drone** as a **co‑performer** for improvisational dance. Two experimental conditions: **Drone‑only** vs **MR.Drone** (with synchronized avatar overlays).
- Stack: **CrazyFlie** (Python), **Unity 2022.3 LTS** on **Meta Quest (OpenXR, XR Interaction Toolkit)**, local **UDP** stream for pose/commands.
- Space & safety: **2×2×2 m** bounded indoor space; no‑fly “intimate” zone near the dancer; takeoff/landing on a mission pad.
- Evaluation: questionnaires (**NASA‑TLX, UEQ‑S, Godspeed, MREQ, SSQ, Circumplex Affect**), semi‑structured interviews, and video observations.
