## Pilot Study Setup
This study is designed as a one-on-one workshop. To capture your expressions, movements, and insights during the different phases, the session will be recorded using cameras placed in the room.

The workshop will involve only the participant and the research team, and it will take place in a space arranged to allow for free movement and safe interaction with the box representing the drone-avatar. The room will be set up to ensure there is enough space for all activities to be conducted comfortably.

- Have motor cooling fan ready - allow drone to cool 2-3 minutes between flights
- Monitor motor temperatures (should be warm, not hot to touch)
- Check propellers for damage after every 3-4 flights

## Battery Safety and Maintenance Guidelines

### Pre-Study Battery Preparation
1. **Inspect all 7 batteries for:**
   - Physical damage (swelling, punctures, dents)
   - Connector damage
   - Wire insulation integrity
   - Expiration date (LiPo batteries have 300-500 cycle lifespan)

2. **Initial Charge Protocol:**
   - Charge in fireproof LiPo bag on non-flammable surface
   - Never charge unattended
   - Charge to 4.2V per cell (100%) maximum
   - Use balance charger with cell monitoring
   - Charging temperature: 15-25°C ambient

3. **Label and Organize:**
   - Label each battery B1-B7 clearly
   - Create tracking sheet for cycle count
   - Note purchase date and first use date

### During Study Day

**Voltage Reference Guide:**
- **4.2V/cell (100%):** Freshly charged - optimal
- **3.9V/cell (80%):** Good for flight - safe minimum
- **3.7V/cell (50%):** Retire for charging - do not fly
- **3.5V/cell (20%):** Critical - charge immediately
- **Below 3.3V/cell:** Potential damage - inspect before recharging

**Charging Rotation Protocol:**
1. After each flight, measure voltage with tester
2. If voltage >3.9V, battery can fly again after 5-min cool-down
3. If voltage 3.7-3.9V, retire for charging
4. Allow 5-10 minute cool-down before charging
5. Never charge a hot battery (wait until warm to touch)
6. Charge to 4.2V per cell before reuse
7. Expected charge time: 45-60 minutes from 3.7V to 4.2V

**Safety Checks Every 30 Minutes:**
- Visually inspect charging batteries
- Check charger temperature
- Verify balanced cell voltages
- Ensure charging area is clear

### Post-Study Storage
1. Discharge batteries to storage voltage: 3.8V per cell (~50%)
2. Store in fireproof LiPo bag in cool, dry location
3. Check voltage weekly if stored long-term
4. Never store fully charged or fully depleted

### Warning Signs - Retire Battery Immediately
- Swelling or puffing
- Damage to outer casing
- Unbalanced cells (>0.1V difference between cells)
- Unusual heat during charging or use
- Capacity loss (noticeably shorter flight times)
- Strange odor

# Pilot Study Script

*Rog will show Slide 1*

## Part 1: Brief Orientation/Introduction
*Rog will show Slide 2*

Hello, I’m [member]. Thank you for participating in this study.  
Before everything else, we’d like to discuss first the context of our study, or what we’re trying to do. While drones have been used in performances, they often feel mechanical, intimidating, or impersonal. We’re exploring how we can use augmentation. Through digital overlays, avatars, and expressive forms, to make drones feel more like dance partners than just flying machines.

There are no right or wrong answers here, we’re simply interested in how you work, what you feel would support you, and your insights on how we can shape or alter your perception of drones in the context of dance performance. Feel free to express any thoughts or ideas throughout the session.

This is a one-on-one Pilot Study and will take approximately 1 hour, divided into 2 Condition. We will also be recording parts of the session to document your expressions and feedback, with cameras positioned to capture your movements and reactions in each phase. Only the research team will have access to this data.

*Rog will show Slide 3*

### Informed Consent and Materials
Before we begin, we'll be handing out the consent forms. Kindly read them carefully and sign them. If you have any concerns, please do not hesitate to let us know.

***Yuan will hand out the following: Informed Consent forms***

**Ju will start recording once the participant submitted the consent form to Yuan**

*Rog will show Slide 4*

## Part 2: *conditions are interchangeable to counterbalance the results*

### MEMBERS' NOTES
**Workshop Structure**
- Participants will be encouraged to dance improvisationally, more on contemporary dance
- [Ju] will assist the participant in setting up the VR and sanitize Meta Quest between participants
- [Yuan] will manage CrazyFlie Brushless 2.1 operations and battery rotations
- **[Designated Team Member]** will monitor battery charging station and log battery usage
- Ask questions and gain insights from their experience to determine how they feel about doing this
- Repeat the process to compare different avatar experiences
- **Monitor participant fatigue** - offer breaks between conditions
- **Safety Protocol:** If participant shows discomfort, immediately land drone and pause session

**Battery Rotation Protocol:**
- Before each participant: Check battery voltage (must be >3.9V)
- After each flight: Log battery usage (participant ID, battery number, flight time)
- If battery drops below 3.7V after flight, retire for charging
- Allow minimum 5-minute cool-down before recharging
- Never leave charging batteries unattended
- Keep fire extinguisher accessible near charging station

**Timing Guidelines per Participant:**
- VR setup and tutorial: 3-4 minutes
- MR.Drone condition (flight + questionnaires): 12-15 minutes
- Transition/break: 3-5 minutes  
- Drone-Only condition (flight + questionnaires): 12-15 minutes
- Comparative interview: 8-10 minutes
- **Total per participant: 40-50 minutes**
- **Buffer time between participants: 5-10 minutes** (for battery swap, VR sanitization, equipment check)

## Condition 1: MR.Drone Experience

### What the participant will experience
You'll wear a Meta Quest 3 headset while a physical CrazyFlie Brushless 2.1 drone flies in the room. In-headset, you'll see a co-located virtual avatar that visually covers (masks) the drone. The drone is small, lightweight, and equipped with brushless motors for smooth, quiet flight. Please respond to the avatar's motion—do not reach for the drone. You may say "Stop" at any time, and we will immediately land the drone.

- [Q6] What confused you only in one condition?

**Identity & Aesthetics**
- [Q7] Did the avatar change the meaning of the drone (character, role, narrative)?
- [Q8] Did either condition interrupt or enhance your personal style?

**Expressiveness & Readability**
- [Q9] Which specific motion best conveyed invitation/response? Which felt ambiguous?
- [Q10] Did you ever “test” it (fake, feint, pause) to see if it would respond? What happened?

**Proxemics & Touch-Imagination**
- [Q11] If you imagine touching it, what part invites contact? Which repels?
- [Q12] When it entered your kinesphere, what changed in your grounding or balance?

**Timing & Musicality**
- [Q13] Did its phrasing complement or compete with your musical interpretation?
- [Q14] If it were your duet partner, who should lead which sections—and why?

**Trust & Safety**
- [Q15] Did you trust it more by the end than at the start? What earned (or lost) trust?
- [Q16] What early warning or “intent signal” would reduce surprises?

**Aesthetics & Identity**
- [Q17] If this avatar were cast in a piece, what role archetype fits (guide, trickster, companion)?
- [Q18] What color/texture/motion tweak would most shift its perceived emotion?

**Recommendations & Future Use**
- [Q18] Top three changes for stage readiness (movement, look, interaction).
- [Q19] If we add haptic, lighting, or sound design, which would most elevate partnering—and how?
- [Q20] What rehearsal tools would you want (speed control, path recording, call-and-response mode)?
- [Q21] In a trio (you + 2 drones/avatars), how should they relate to you and to each other?
- [Q22] What ethical/safety boundaries should be explicit for performers and tech crew?
