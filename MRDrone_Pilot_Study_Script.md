# MR.Drone User Study —  CHECKLIST

---

## Pilot Study Setup
This study is designed as a one-on-one pilot. To capture your expressions, movements, and insights during the different phases, the session will be recorded using cameras placed in the room.

The pilot will involve only the participant and the research team, and it will take place in a space arranged to allow for free movement and safe interaction with the box representing the drone-avatar. The room will be set up to ensure there is enough space for all activities to be conducted comfortably.

# Pilot Study Script

*Rog will show Slide 1*

## Part 1: Brief Orientation/Introduction
*Rog will show Slide 2*

Hello, I’m [member]. Thank you for participating in this study.  
Before everything else, we’d like to discuss first the context of our study, or what we’re trying to do. While drones have been used in performances, they often feel mechanical, intimidating, or impersonal. We’re exploring how we can use augmentation. Through digital overlays, avatars, and expressive forms, to make drones feel more like dance partners than just flying machines.

There are no right or wrong answers here, we’re simply interested in how you work, what you feel would support you, and your insights on how we can shape or alter your perception of drones in the context of dance performance. Feel free to express any thoughts or ideas throughout the session.

This is a one-on-one Pilot Study and will take approximately 1 hour, divided into 2 Condition. We will also be recording parts of the session to document your expressions and feedback, with cameras positioned to capture your movements and reactions in each phase. Only the research team will have access to this data.

## Part 2: *conditions are interchangeable to counterbalance the results*

### MEMBERS' NOTES
**Workshop Structure**
- Participants will be encouraged to dance improvisationally, more on contemporary dance
- [Ju] will assist the participant in setting up the VR and sanitize Meta Quest between participants
- [Yuan] will manage CrazyFlie Brushless 2.1 operations and battery rotations
- **[Designated Team Member]** will monitor battery charging station and log battery usage
- Ask questions and gain insights from their experience to determine how they feel about doing this
- Repeat the process to compare different avatar experiences
- **Monitor participant fatigue** - offer breaks between conditions
- **Safety Protocol:** If participant shows discomfort, immediately land drone and pause session

**Battery Rotation Protocol:**
- Before each participant: Check battery voltage (must be >3.9V)
- After each flight: Log battery usage (participant ID, battery number, flight time)
- If battery drops below 3.7V after flight, retire for charging
- Allow minimum 5-minute cool-down before recharging
- Never leave charging batteries unattended
- Keep fire extinguisher accessible near charging station

**Timing Guidelines per Participant:**
- VR setup and tutorial: 3-4 minutes
- MR.Drone condition (flight + questionnaires): 12-15 minutes
- Transition/break: 3-5 minutes  
- Drone-Only condition (flight + questionnaires): 12-15 minutes
- Comparative interview: 8-10 minutes
- **Total per participant: 40-50 minutes**
- **Buffer time between participants: 5-10 minutes** (for battery swap, VR sanitization, equipment check)

## Condition 1: MR.Drone Experience

### What the participant will experience
You'll wear a Meta Quest 3 headset while a physical CrazyFlie Brushless 2.1 drone flies in the room. In-headset, you'll see a co-located virtual avatar that visually covers (masks) the drone. The drone is small, lightweight, and equipped with brushless motors for smooth, quiet flight. Please respond to the avatar's motion—do not reach for the drone. You may say "Stop" at any time, and we will immediately land the drone.

### Flow
- **Pre-flight check (30 seconds)**  
  [Yuan]: Verify battery voltage >3.9V, check prop security, confirm radio link, clear flight zone
- **Quick VR tutorial (1 min)**  
  Headset fit & focus; how to see panels; "Stop" button meaning; emergency procedures explained
- **Panels sequence (guided) (1–2 min)**  
  About → Instructions → Onboarding
- **Pre-SSQ (1 min)**  
  Collect using in-VR panel
- **Begin Routine (~3 min)**  
  [Rog]: "Move freely; breathe; find your rhythm with the avatar; you can stop anytime."  
  [Yuan]: Arm CrazyFlie Brushless 2.1, send routine signal, monitor flight parameters  
  **NOTE:** If participant signals discomfort → **Stop immediately**; log timestamp & symptom; safe landing protocol
- **Post-flight check (30 seconds)**  
  [Yuan]: Land drone, check motor temperatures, log battery voltage, note any anomalies
- **Post-block questionnaires (~8–9 min total)**  
  - NASA-TLX  
  - Godspeed (anthropomorphism, likeability, perceived safety/animacy as applicable)  
  - MREQ (adapted)  
  - UEQ-S  
  - Circumplex Model of Affect
  
**[During questionnaires: Battery rotation if needed]**

### INTERVIEW
**Perception & Presence**
- [Q1] On a 1–5, how “present” did the virtual drone avatar feel? Why not higher/lower?
- [Q2] Did the avatar feel co-located with you, or offset/misaligned at times? When?
- [Q3] At any moment did you forget the headset and relate to it as a partner? Describe.

**Expressiveness & Agency**
- [Q4] What gesture or motion made the avatar feel most “alive” or intentional?
- [Q5] Did you attribute mood/emotion to it (curious, shy, assertive)? What signaled that?

**Safety, Comfort, Proxemics**
- [Q6] When it came close, what did your body do (freeze, reach, step, turn)? Why?
- [Q7] Did you feel you could safely predict its path? Any near-misses or hesitations?

**Workload & Flow**
- [Q8] What demanded most effort: tracking visually, timing, spacing, or learning the UI?
- [Q9] Did you hit a flow state? What helped or broke it (latency, FOV, music, cues)?

**Mapping, Timing, Cues**
- [Q10] Did sound/music and avatar motion feel synchronized? If not, how off?
- [Q11] Were system cues (panels, start/stop) visible at the right moments?

**Design Feedback**
- [Q12] If we changed one thing about the avatar’s look or motion for next time, what is it?
- [Q13] What single behavior would make it more partner-like for you?

## Part 3: Experience Discussion

Thank you! Now that you’ve danced with the both the conditions, let’s talk a bit about how it felt.

**Direct Comparisons**
- [Q1] Where did you feel more supported—MR.Drone or Drone-Only? Example moment?
- [Q2] Which condition better invited risk-taking or play? Why?
- [Q3] Which condition felt safer, and which felt clearer to read?
- [Q4] If you had to perform on stage tomorrow, which version would you pick, and what would you tweak?

**Transfer & Learning**
- [Q5] Did skills from the first condition transfer to the second (timing, spacing, trust)?
- [Q6] What confused you only in one condition?

**Identity & Aesthetics**
- [Q7] Did the avatar change the meaning of the drone (character, role, narrative)?
- [Q8] Did either condition interrupt or enhance your personal style?

**Expressiveness & Readability**
- [Q9] Which specific motion best conveyed invitation/response? Which felt ambiguous?
- [Q10] Did you ever “test” it (fake, feint, pause) to see if it would respond? What happened?

**Proxemics & Touch-Imagination**
- [Q11] If you imagine touching it, what part invites contact? Which repels?
- [Q12] When it entered your kinesphere, what changed in your grounding or balance?

**Timing & Musicality**
- [Q13] Did its phrasing complement or compete with your musical interpretation?
- [Q14] If it were your duet partner, who should lead which sections—and why?

**Trust & Safety**
- [Q15] Did you trust it more by the end than at the start? What earned (or lost) trust?
- [Q16] What early warning or “intent signal” would reduce surprises?

**Aesthetics & Identity**
- [Q17] If this avatar were cast in a piece, what role archetype fits (guide, trickster, companion)?
- [Q18] What color/texture/motion tweak would most shift its perceived emotion?

**Recommendations & Future Use**
- [Q18] Top three changes for stage readiness (movement, look, interaction).
- [Q19] If we add haptic, lighting, or sound design, which would most elevate partnering—and how?
- [Q20] What rehearsal tools would you want (speed control, path recording, call-and-response mode)?
- [Q21] In a trio (you + 2 drones/avatars), how should they relate to you and to each other?
- [Q22] What ethical/safety boundaries should be explicit for performers and tech crew?
