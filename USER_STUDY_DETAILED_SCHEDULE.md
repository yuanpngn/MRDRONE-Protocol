   - *Follow-up:* What would make you rate it higher? Lower?

2. **Did the avatar feel perfectly aligned with the physical drone, or did you notice any misalignment?**
   - *Follow-up:* If misaligned, describe what you saw (e.g., offset position, lag, rotation error).

3. **At any point, did you forget you were wearing a headset and fully immerse in the experience with the avatar as a partner?**
   - *Follow-up:* Describe that moment. What triggered the immersion?

### **Expressiveness & Perceived Agency**
4. **What specific movement or gesture made the avatar feel most "alive" or intentional to you?**
   - *Follow-up:* Was it the speed, direction, height, or something else?

5. **Did you sense any emotions or intentions from the avatar (e.g., curious, shy, playful, assertive)?**
   - *Follow-up:* What visual or motion cues communicated that emotion?

6. **If you could describe the avatar's "personality" in 3 words, what would they be?**

### **Safety & Proxemics**
7. **When the avatar/drone approached you closely, what was your immediate physical response?**
   - *Options: Did you freeze, step back, reach toward it, turn away, lean in, or something else?*
   - *Follow-up:* Why did you respond that way?

8. **Did you feel you could safely predict where it would move next?**
   - *Follow-up:* Were there any "near-miss" moments that surprised you or made you hesitant?

9. **What distance felt most comfortable for you? What distance felt too close or too far?**

### **Workload & Cognitive Demand**
10. **What aspect of the experience demanded the most mental effort?**
    - *Options: Tracking visually, timing your movements, managing personal space, understanding instructions, navigating the VR interface*

11. **Did you reach a "flow state" where you felt fully engaged without overthinking?**
    - *Follow-up:* What helped you reach flow (e.g., music, avatar motion, clear cues)? What broke it (e.g., lag, distraction, confusion)?

### **Timing, Synchronization, & Music**
12. **Did the music and the avatar's motion feel synchronized to you?**
    - *Follow-up:* If not, how off did they feel? (e.g., delayed by 1-2 seconds, completely unrelated)

13. **Did the music help you connect with the avatar, or did it feel distracting?**

14. **Were the on-screen panels (About, Instructions, Start/Stop button) visible and helpful at the right moments?**

### **Design Feedback**

    - *Options: Sound of motors, air flow on skin, visual trajectory, LED lights, distance*

### **Safety & Spatial Awareness**
19. **When did you feel safest during the drone interaction? When did you feel least safe?**

20. **What "personal space rule" did you unconsciously create for yourself?**
    - *Example: "I kept at least 1 meter away," "I avoided being directly under it"*

### **Expressiveness**
21. **Which of the drone's movement patterns felt most "expressive" to you, if any?**
    - *Follow-up:* What would make the drone more expressive without adding visual augmentation?

22. **If we could add ONE non-VR enhancement (e.g., colored lights, different motor sounds, physical props attached), what would you suggest?**

### **Workload & Focus**
23. **What was the most challenging aspect of dancing with the physical drone?**
    - *Options: Predicting its path, hearing over motor noise, managing fear/anxiety, timing*

24. **Did the motor noise help or hinder your sense of timing and rhythm?**

## **Section 3: Comparative Questions (After Both Conditions)**

### **Direct Comparisons**
25. **In which condition did you feel more supported as a dancer—MR.Drone or Drone-Only?**
    - *Follow-up:* Can you describe a specific moment that illustrates this?

26. **Which condition made you feel more willing to take creative risks or explore playful movements?**
    - *Follow-up:* Why do you think that is?

27. **Which condition felt safer? Which felt clearer and easier to read?**

28. **If you had to perform on stage tomorrow with one of these setups, which would you choose?**
    - *Follow-up:* What would you want us to tweak before the performance?

### **Transfer & Learning**
29. **Did any skills or insights from the first condition carry over to the second?**
    - *Examples: Timing, spatial awareness, trust in the system*

30. **Was there anything that confused you in one condition but not the other?**

### **Identity & Aesthetics**
31. **Did the virtual avatar change the "meaning" or "role" of the drone for you?**
    - *Follow-up:* Did it feel like a character, a narrative element, or something else?

32. **Did either condition interrupt your personal dance style, or did one enhance it more?**

### **Expressiveness & Readability**
33. **Which specific motion or gesture best conveyed an "invitation" or "response" between you and the system?**

34. **Which motion felt most ambiguous or hard to interpret?**

35. **Did you ever "test" the system—like faking a movement, feinting, or pausing—to see if it would respond?**
    - *Follow-up:* What happened?

### **Proxemics & Touch Imagination**
36. **If you could imagine touching the avatar or drone, which part would feel inviting to touch? Which part would you avoid?**

37. **When the avatar/drone entered your "personal space bubble" (kinesphere), how did your body react?**
    - *Examples: Changed balance, shifted weight, tensed up, relaxed, opened arms*

### **Timing & Musicality**
38. **Did the system's movement phrasing complement or compete with how you interpreted the music?**

39. **If this were a duet and you could choreograph it, who should lead which sections—you or the avatar/drone?**
    - *Follow-up:* Why?

### **Trust & Safety Development**
40. **Did your trust in the system increase or decrease from the start to the end of the session?**
    - *Follow-up:* What earned (or lost) that trust?

41. **What kind of early warning signal or "intent cue" would help you feel more prepared for the system's next move?**
    - *Examples: Sound cue, light change, slowing down before turning*

### **Aesthetics & Role**
42. **If this avatar were cast in a dance piece, what role archetype would fit best?**
    - *Options: Guide, trickster, companion, observer, challenger, protector, muse*

43. **What single change in color, texture, or motion would most shift the avatar's perceived emotion?**
    - *Example: "Softer edges would make it feel gentler," "Faster spins would make it feel playful"*

## **Section 4: Recommendations & Future Use**

### **Stage Readiness**
44. **What are your top THREE changes we should make before this system is ready for a live performance?**
    - *Consider: Movement design, visual appearance, interaction responsiveness, safety, ease of use*

45. **If we could add haptic feedback (e.g., vibration in a wristband when the drone approaches), lighting effects on the drone, or spatialized sound design, which would most elevate the partnering experience?**
    - *Follow-up:* How would you want it to work?

### **Rehearsal Tools**
46. **What rehearsal or practice tools would you want to have as a performer working with this system?**
    - *Examples: Speed control, path recording and playback, call-and-response mode, ability to "teach" the drone*

47. **How much control would you want over the system during a performance?**
    - *Options: Fully autonomous (drone follows preset choreography), semi-autonomous (drone responds to you), manual control (you control it via gesture or device)*

### **Multi-Drone Scenarios**
48. **Imagine a trio: you + 2 drones/avatars. How should they relate to you and to each other?**
    - *Follow-up:* Should they move independently, mirror each other, or respond to you as a group?

49. **Would you want the two drones to have distinct "personalities" or appearances, or should they be identical?**

### **Ethical & Safety Boundaries**
50. **What ethical or safety boundaries should be made explicit for performers and the technical crew when using this system?**
    - *Examples: Maximum flight time before performer fatigue, safe distances, consent for audience interaction*

51. **If this technology were used in a public performance, what should audience members know beforehand?**

---

## **Section 5: Open-Ended Reflection**

52. **What surprised you most about this experience?**

53. **If you could describe this experience to a fellow dancer in one sentence, what would you say?**

54. **Do you have any additional thoughts, ideas, or concerns you'd like to share that we haven't covered?**

55. **Would you be interested in performing with a system like this in a future production? Why or why not?**

4.1V = 95% ✓ GOOD
4.0V = 85% ✓ GOOD  
3.9V = 80% ⚠️ MINIMUM for flight
3.8V = 65% ⚠️ STORAGE voltage
3.7V = 50% ⛔ DO NOT FLY - Charge now
3.6V = 35% ⛔ CRITICAL
3.5V = 20% ⛔ CRITICAL
<3.3V = ⛔ DAMAGED - Inspect before charging

SAFE FLIGHT RANGE: 3.9V - 4.2V per cell
```

## **Appendix D: Motor Temperature Guide**
```
MOTOR TEMPERATURE CHECK

AFTER FLIGHT:
- Touch motor casing briefly with finger
- WARM = OK (continue use after 2-3 min cool-down)
- HOT (uncomfortable to hold 3 sec) = Cooling break needed (5-10 min)
- VERY HOT (painful to touch) = STOP - Inspect for damage

IF MOTORS CONSISTENTLY OVERHEAT:
1. Check for propeller damage/imbalance
2. Verify motor mounting is secure
3. Extend cooling time between flights
4. Reduce flight duration to 5 minutes max
5. Consider swapping to backup CrazyFlie
